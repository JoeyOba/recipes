        <li>Onions: 1-2 medium-sized onions (diced)</li>
        <li>Red bell pepper: 1-2, diced</li>
        <li>Scotch bonnet pepper or hot pepper: 1-2 (adjust according to your spice preference)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil or palm oil: 1/4 to 1/2 cup (palm oil is traditional but vegetable oil is commonly used)</li>
        <li>Chicken or vegetable broth: 2-3 cups</li>
        <li>Bay leaves: 2-3</li>
        <li>Thyme: 1 teaspoon (dried or fresh)</li>
        <li>Curry powder: 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Ground paprika or cayenne pepper: 1/2 teaspoon (optional, for additional heat)</li>
        <li>Salt: to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
    <li>In a blender, combine tomatoes, red bell pepper, onions, and scotch bonnet pepper. Blend until smooth.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a pot, add diced onions, and saut√© until translucent.</li>
    <li>Add tomato paste to the pot and cook for a few minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
    <li>Pour in the blended tomato mixture, add bay leaves, thyme, curry powder, paprika (if using), salt, and black pepper. Cook the sauce until it thickens and the oil begins to separate from the mixture.</li>
    <li>Add the rice to the pot and stir to coat the rice with the tomato mixture.</li>
    <li>Pour in the broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a lid, and simmer until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
    <li>Optional: Add cooked protein (chicken, fish, shrimp) at this stage and mix gently.</li>
    <li>Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork, remove the bay leaves, and let it sit covered for a few minutes before serving.</li>
